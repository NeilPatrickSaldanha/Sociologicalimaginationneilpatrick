<h3>About Sociological Imagination</h3>
<p>Sociological imagination is basically the connection of our personal world and the world around us. The concept was formulated by the American sociologist C. Wright Mills in his 1959 book "The sociological imagination". The concept and book were actually a response to major trends happening in sociology at the time which Mills defined as functional grand theory. This notion of grand theory was attributed to the work of sociologists, and what is known as the functionalist school of sociology.
   Grand theory can be defined as a method of sociological analysis that focuses on the abstract building and arrangement of society ,organizations and structures. 
   Now this was abstract because there wasn't any observation or analysis of individuals and groups. All that it consisted of was that thinking up of different social categories and components that could be fit together into an ideal model of how society should be run or in other words, grand theaters from more concern with the order of these models and not with the complex messy everyday lives of individuals and their interactions.</p>
